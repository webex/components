**Webex Components** is a set of [React](https://reactjs.org) components following Webex standard styling,
aimed at react developers that want to embed the components into their applications.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @webex/components
```

## Usage

### Styles

In order to properly style Webex Components, we need to import all the fonts, icons, images and core _CSS_ manually.
Import `@webex/components/dist/webexComponents.css` into your main entry file.

There are two ways to do this:

#### JavaScript

In your `index.js`, add the following import:

```js
import '@webex/components/dist/webexComponents.css';
...
```

#### HTML

In the `<head>` of your `index.html`, add the following import:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="node_modules/@webex/components/dist/webexComponents.css" />
</head>
```

### Adapters
Webex Components are self-updating, meaning, they know how to fetch the data they need.
Data is passed to components via adapter classes (see [adapters](./src/adapters)).
Adapters are an uniform interface for the Webex Components to consume.
They also know how to map the data from their data source to the data the components need.

To use a Webex Component, start by creating a Webex Adapter:
```js
import {WebexAdapter} from '@webex/components';

const adapter = new WebexAdapter();
```

Adapters may interact with different data source types.
For instance, as part of the Webex Component repository we distribute a [JSON adapter](./src/adapters) that reads data from JSON files.
We also are working on offering [an adapter](https://github.com/webex/sdk-component-adapter) for the [Webex browser SDK](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk).

### Components

Putting everything together - styles, adapters and components - this is a simple example of how using a component would look like:

```js
import '@webex/components/dist/webexComponents.css';

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {WebexAdapter, WebexAvatar} from '@webex/components';

const adapter = new WebexAdapter();

ReactDOM.render(
  <WebexAvatar personId="XYZ" adapter={adapter} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

_Happy Coding!_

## Contributing

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make **Webex Components** even better than it is today! Here are some [guidelines](https://github.com/webex/components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) that we'd like you to follow.

### Issues

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/webex/components/issues) and we will get to it in an orderly manner.
Please leave as much as information as possible for a better understanding.

### Contributing Code

We are using [Webex Style Guide eslint rule](https://github.com/webex/web-styleguide/tree/master/packages/node_modules/%40webex/eslint-config-react) and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to lint the code style.
You can "prettify" your code before committing via:

```bash
npm run prettier:write
```

### Release Process

There is a list of commit types provided [here](https://github.com/webex/components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type). However, not all commits trigger our release process.
We are using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to fully automate the version management and package publishing.
By default `semantic-release` uses the [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) and triggers release and publishing based on the following rules:

| Commit                             | Release type  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Commit with type `BREAKING CHANGE` | Major release |
| Commit with type `feat`            | Minor release |
| Commit with type `fix`             | Patch release |
| Commit with type `perf`            | Patch release |

#### Commit linter

We are using [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to lintify the commit messages.
Please make sure to choose the appropriate commit [type](https://github.com/webex/components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type), [scope](https://github.com/webex/components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#scope) and [subject](https://github.com/webex/components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#scope).
